# Windeau

Windeau is a windowing/widgeting extension for termbox that came out
of the necessity for more flexible and controllable windows than just
what came with termbox.

Currently it just supports building empty windows that have titles.

You can see the windows in action by doing:

`go run _demos/windows.go`

Press the any key to quit the demo
